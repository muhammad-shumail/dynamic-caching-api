Dynamically Caching Data from JSONPlaceholder API
This is a simple web application that fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and caches it dynamically in the browser using localStorage. The application uses the axios library to make HTTP requests and the jquery library for DOM manipulation.

How it works
The application first checks if there is cached data in localStorage and if it is not expired, it serves the cached data. Otherwise, it fetches the data from the API and caches it for future use.

When making the HTTP request, the application includes the If-Modified-Since header with the value of the lastModified timestamp stored in localStorage. If the server responds with a 304 Not Modified status code, it means that the cached version is still valid and the data is served from the cache.

When the server responds with the actual data, the application checks the Cache-Control header for the max-age value, which specifies how long the data can be cached. The data is stored in localStorage along with the lastModified timestamp, and the expiration time is set using the setTimeout function.

How to use it
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The application will automatically fetch and display the data from the JSONPlaceholder API.

Future improvements
Add error handling for failed HTTP requests.
Allow users to specify the API endpoint and other settings through a configuration file.
Use a more robust caching strategy, such as the Cache API or Service Workers.
